\begin{abstract}
Multi-party computation (MPC) is a cryptographic protocol that allows parties to learn the output of some function of their private inputs without trusting a third party to perform the computation. This is usually done at a large scale between data centers, with little emphasis on individuals' devices or mobile hardware. In this paper, I present a proof-of-concept implementation of two-party computation on a commodity smartphone paired with a low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA). I compare the performance and power consumption of the system between a software-only setup and a setup with the FPGA coprocessor used for acceleration. I find a calculated $260\times$ speed improvement assuming a saturated serial connection, and no significant difference in battery life.
